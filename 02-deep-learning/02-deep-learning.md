# Deep Learning

In the ever-evolving field of artificial intelligence, deep learning is one of the most transformative technological
breakthroughs of our time. At its core, deep learning represents a fundamental shift in the way we approach machine
intelligence. Unlike traditional programming where humans carefully design rules and decision paths, deep learning
algorithms have a remarkable ability to learn from experience. Through exposure to large amounts of data, deep learning
algorithms can discover patterns and extract features with increasing levels of abstraction, in some ways mirroring how
our own brains understand the world around us.

Deep learning is considered a newly developed sub-field of machine learning. The ‘deep’ in deep learning refers to the
multi-layer processing capabilities that these algorithms have. Each layer builds on the one before it, working together
to transform raw input into increasingly complex and abstract representations. From recognizing faces in photographs and
understanding human language, to predicting protein structure and detecting anomalies in medical images, this
multi-layer learning approach has been proven to be exceptionally effective at handling complex tasks that once seemed
beyond the capabilities of artificial intelligence.
